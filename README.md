## Overview

The Boyer-Moore algorithm is a versatile pattern matching technique that excels at searching for multiple patterns in a text. This implementation provides both single-pattern and multi-pattern search capabilities. It preprocesses the text and patterns to efficiently locate all occurrences of the specified patterns within the text.

## How to Use

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fololorose/String-Matching.git
   ```

2. Compile the Java code:

   ```bash
   javac BoyerMoore.java
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java BoyerMoore
   ```

4. You can customize the `text` and `patterns` variables in the `main` method to test different input data.

## Algorithm Details

The Boyer-Moore algorithm uses two preprocessing steps: bad character and good suffix shifts. It efficiently compares patterns with the text, taking advantage of mismatches to skip unnecessary comparisons.

- **Bad Character Shift**: Preprocesses a bad character matrix to determine shifts based on mismatched characters.

- **Good Suffix Shift**: Preprocesses a shift array for good suffixes to optimize pattern matching.
